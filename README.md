# HTPCManager

Simple Laptop manager, whenever the laptop switches to battery then it will turn off the laptop in graceful manner.

I have been using this tool with IR remote control power plug combination.

Laptop is used as HTPC, which is permanently connected to TV, whenever TV is turned off the laptop also turn off.

Enable BIOS setting to turn on laptop whenever power on flag
